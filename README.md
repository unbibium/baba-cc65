BABA IS YOU C64 demake, cc65 version
====================================

In March 2019, Arvi "Hempuli" Teikari released a puzzle game called Baba Is You
for PC, Mac, and Nintendo Switch. It's a game where you solve puzzles by 
pushing tiles around, some of which change the rules of the game and the 
properties of objects. 

I loved the concept, and I loved the game, but somehow instead of having the 
itch to play it, I got the itch to run it on 8-bit hardware.

I got farther than I expected, though this isn't a complete game yet.

Don't you already have another one of these?
--------------------------------------------

This is a cc65 port of my c64 BASIC demake of Baba Is You, which
I've published elsewhere on github.

I worked on this mostly in late 2020, early 2021, because the
BASIC version was just too slow.  Compiling it with BasicBOSS
made it playable, but editing it in BASIC was starting to
become cumbersome.  I needed to be able to expand its rule
set, and maybe introduce custom graphics and better animation
eventually.

So I have this version, which is about up to the point that
the BASIC version is at, minus the level editor.  There is even 
a branch that uses 2x2 tiles that look more like the original game.
